# Daily Notes

Welcome to your first desktop article.

This space can be used like a lightweight note app. Because it's a simple Markdown file, you can:

- Capture quick thoughts
- Jot down todos
- Keep reference snippets

## Today

- Review your projects
- Tidy up your workspace
- Take a short break away from the screen

Remember: small, consistent improvements beat massive one‑off efforts.
